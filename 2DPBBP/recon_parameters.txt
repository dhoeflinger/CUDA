Reconstruct a 512x512 image using backprojection (with linear interpolation) and the following reconstruction paramters
Projection data is already filtered.
Note that the ReadData script is useful for loading these files into matlab.

Parallel Beam

	Projection data (thorax_par_projections.dat)
	735 detectors
	768 views
	Data stored as floating point with first two values in file are these dimensions (4-byte integer) 

	Detector spacing = 1
	Central Detector = 367
	Source Angles = Evenly spaced on [0, pi)
	Reconstruction pixel size = 1


Example Reconstructed Image in
	thorax_par.img
	Image files are 512x512 floating point (4-byte) data with two 4-byte integer header with size information
